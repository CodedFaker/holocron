If you are not a Star Wars fan, I'm sure you are potentially curious as to how I have come to naming this blog. Holocrons were storage devices used by both the Jedi Order and the Sith that contained ancient lessons, wisdom, or valuable information. Anyone who sought one out and managed to access one would later use the knowledge to grow. In some way I hope that this blog will serve a similar purpose, and give those who lack definitive direction on a path in IT, a sort of jumping point.

If you have made it to this point, I must have piqued your interest in some way. With that said, I am honored that a single person would take time from their day to even take a brief glance at this sort of epitaph of mine. If you find what I do helpful, please share it with others to help give more of a fighting chance. The journey is more important than the end or the start, so join me in creating something meaningful. May the force be with you!

TLDR: I'm a guy trying to give back in the best way I can think of.
