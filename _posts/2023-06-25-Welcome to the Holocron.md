**Hey** there! I'm Alvin, a passionate Information Technology (IT) professional who's dedicated to helping others succeed in the world of ones and zeros. I am a Network Administrator with nearly a decade of IT experience. With that experience, I have felt the need to create "Holocron" as a means to teach others things I wish someone had taught me when I started my journey. As the current market of anything IT is difficult to enter into (or progress toward), I hope that all of my efforts will help to eliminate many barriers which many people face today. One thing to know about me is that I love helping people, because I remember all of the times in which I unnecessarily struggled attempting to learn something.

If you are not a Star Wars fan, I'm sure you are potentially curious as to how I have come to naming this blog. Holocrons were storage devices used by both the Jedi Order and the Sith that contained ancient lessons, wisdom, or valuable information. Anyone who sought one out and managed to access one would later use the knowledge to grow. In some way I hope that this blog will serve a similar purpose, and give those who lack definitive direction on a path in IT, a sort of jumping point.

If you have made it to this point, I must have piqued your interest in some way. With that said, I am honored that a single person would take time from their day to even take a brief glance at this sort of epitaph of mine. If you find what I do helpful, please share it with others to help give more of a fighting chance. The journey is more important than the end or the start, so join me in creating something meaningful. May the force be with you!

TLDR: I'm a guy trying to give back in the best way I can think of.
